i want this app to use auth, map and grpahs and 
Damove is a club connection app. I. Will make using an fp approach the classes are clubber and promoter and an app class for all the interactions between them
	-it will connect promoters to club goers that want to party.
		-promoter can post there section info, date, cost, and special request
		 as well as a photo of the venue or section
		 also the amount of club sections sold is monitored and graphed
	-a user can post there information for promoters to contact them 
		they can also sift through which club sections are open
 		the amount of clubbing is graphed

    - we also make a confirm page when one is selected and the and then we have alert when it accepted

	-It will require authentication 
	- it will use a map to see how far you are from club location 


Fp

		-a method would be after 12:00 Monday all the data is erased
	-user
		-a method would be to add a promoter to an array of people you want to contact
		
	-promoter
		-a method would be to add a user to an array of people you want to contact

	- the confim page is clickeed when a person clicks on a promoters page or a promoteer
Technologies 
	I will user multer express node crypt chart.js map box cdn and a Postgres database 


finish that
put all the parts and components needed

today to connect the parts and get it functional 
	-we got to conncect data to the graph and start styling it then we will put to gether
	-we need to get the list then make each part of the list and it goes to the confirmation page 

then style 

on the user page 
	-after we get the form we see all the promoters they contact and the club picture 
	- they go to the confirm page and see the distance and amount fo open sections 
	-we get all the club events for the appropriate date

on promoter paage after we get the info we 
	-we get a list of the perople who want to go to the club 
	- the promoters get a list of the daily club goesr and can contact them
	

	in our auth we need to adjust for if we have the username alreay if so we vant log it in and if there is a duplicate it wont be queried anyway
