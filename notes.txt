i want this app to use auth, map and grpahs and 
Damove is a club connection app. I. Will make using an fp approach the classes are clubber and promoter and an app class for all the interactions between them
	-it will connect promoters to club goers that want to party.
		-promoter can post there section info, date, cost, and special request
		 as well as a photo of the venue or section
		 also the amount of club sections sold is monitored and graphed
	-a user can post there information for promoters to contact them 
		they can also sift through which club sections are open
 		the amount of clubbing is graphed

    - we also make a confirm page when one is selected and the and then we have alert when it accepted

	-It will require authentication 
	- it will use a map to see how far you are from club location 


Fp
