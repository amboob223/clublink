    Check the Dishwasher:

Inspect the dishwasher for any visible signs of food debris or mold. Remove any leftover food particles from the dishwasher's filter or drain area.
Run an empty cycle with a dishwasher cleaner or a mixture of vinegar and baking soda to clean and deodorize the machine.
Inspect the Sink:

Check the sink and garbage disposal for any food scraps or residue that might be causing the odor. Clean the sink and disposal thoroughly.
Run hot water and dispose of a few ice cubes and citrus peels in the garbage disposal to help freshen it up.
Drains:

If the smell persists, it could be coming from the drains. Pour a mixture of baking soda and vinegar down the drains, let it sit for a while, and then flush with hot water.
Air Ventilation:

Ensure that your kitchen is well-ventilated. Proper airflow can help dissipate odors.
Clogged Pipes:

In some cases, odors can arise from clogged or partially blocked plumbing. If the smell continues, consider having a plumber inspect your pipes.
Regular Cleaning:

Regularly clean your kitchen appliances, sinks, and drains to prevent the buildup of residue and odors.
Avoid Leaving Dishes in the Dishwasher:

Leaving dirty dishes in the dishwasher for an extended period can contribute to odors. Try to wash dishes promptly.
